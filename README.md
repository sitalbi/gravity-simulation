# gravity-simulation
Gravity simulation created with OpenGL

## To do 
Create bodies or objects (similar to unity's rigidbody) that store position, velocity etc...

In the first version we only store position.
This position can be updated and the Model matrix is calculated in the Draw function.

The body also store the its Model instance (Cube, Sphere, etc...)
Only one Model per type has to be created for the moment.
